## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Site skeleton deployed to GitHub Pages.
- University of Oregon Fall Census salary records for every census from 2014 to
  2025 - 80,692 job records, classified and unclassified, from the salary
  reports on the Office of Data Enablement's salary reports page, retrieved
  2026-09-24 - as one JSON file per year under `public/data/fall/`. Each record
  keeps every field the report publishes, with its source page number.
- A data manifest listing each source report's file name, SHA-256, page count,
  extract date, retrieval date, and record count.
- Records whose job title suggests a student or graduate employee are marked
  `possibleStudent`.
- `pnpm scrape`, which rebuilds the data from Fall Census PDFs downloaded into
  `.cache/sources/fall/`, and refuses to write a year with any unreadable record
  or a missing or duplicate report.
